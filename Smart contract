Here's a simple example of a smart contract AI written in Python. Since actual smart contracts run on blockchains like Ethereum (using Solidity), what you're asking for is probably an AI agent that can interact with smart contracts, not a contract written in Python directly.

So here's a Python script that acts as a smart contract AI assistant using Web3.py. This script connects to the Ethereum network, checks a contract's balance, and can call functions from the contract using AI decision-making (in a simplified way):

from web3 import Web3
import openai

# Connect to Ethereum node (e.g., Infura)
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider("https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"))

# Contract details
contract_address = Web3.to_checksum_address("0xYourContractAddress")
contract_abi = [...]  # Paste the contract ABI here

# Connect to the contract
contract = web3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=contract_abi)

# AI decision-making (using OpenAI as an example)
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

def ask_ai(prompt):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']

# Example: Get contract balance and let AI decide what to do
balance = web3.eth.get_balance(contract_address)
eth_balance = web3.from_wei(balance, 'ether')

print(f"Contract balance: {eth_balance} ETH")

# Ask AI what to do based on balance
prompt = f"The contract has {eth_balance} ETH. What should we do?"
ai_decision = ask_ai(prompt)

print("AI suggests:", ai_decision)

# Optional: Based on AI response, call a function (example only)
# tx = contract.functions.someFunction().build_transaction({...})
