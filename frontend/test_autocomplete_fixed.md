# Testing the Fixed GenVM Autocomplete

## How to Test

1. Open the Studio frontend at http://localhost:8080
2. Navigate to the Simulator and open/create a contract
3. Open the browser's Developer Console (F12) to see debug logs

## Test the Following:

### Basic Test
Type the following and check for completions:

```python
gl.
```

**Expected:**
- You should see debug log: `[GenVM Autocomplete] Line prefix: gl.`
- You should see debug log: `[GenVM Autocomplete] Returning X items`
- Completions should appear showing: eq_principle, nondet, message, storage, vm, advanced, evm, public, Contract, ContractAt, Event, trace, etc.

### With Whitespace (Your Original Issue)
Type `gl.` followed by a space:

```python
gl.
```

**Expected:**
- Debug logs should still show the autocomplete being triggered
- Completions should still appear even with trailing whitespace

### Nested Modules
Try these patterns:
- `gl.nondet.` → should show: web, exec_prompt
- `gl.nondet.web.` → should show: render, request, get, post, delete, head, patch
- `gl.storage.` → should show: inmem_allocate, copy_to_memory, Root

## Check Console Output

In the browser console, you should see logs like:
```
[GenVM Autocomplete] Line prefix: gl.
[GenVM Autocomplete] Returning 17 items
```

## Troubleshooting

If autocomplete is not working:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R)
3. Make sure you're in a Python contract file
4. Try typing slowly to give the autocomplete time to trigger

## Changes Made to Fix the Issue:

1. **Fixed regex patterns**: Now matches `gl.` with optional trailing whitespace
2. **Removed undefined range**: Let Monaco handle range calculation automatically
3. **Fixed registration order**: Autocomplete is registered before creating the editor
4. **Added debug logging**: To help diagnose any remaining issues
5. **Added quick suggestions**: Enabled for better autocomplete experience
