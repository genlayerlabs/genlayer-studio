# Directory for TLS certificates and keys

Place your TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificates and private keys for NGINX in this directory. These files are essential for enabling HTTPS, ensuring secure communication, and authenticating server identity.

   - Certificates (.crt or .pem): Store public certificates issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) here.
   - Private Keys (.key): Store corresponding private keys securely here.

Ensure correct file permissions to maintain security and limit access to sensitive key files.
