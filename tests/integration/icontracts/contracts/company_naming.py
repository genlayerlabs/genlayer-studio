Company Name: {company_name}
Description: {description}

Output format - Respond using ONLY the following format:
{{
"analysis": str detailed analysis of name-description alignment,
"score": int between 0-10 being the overall alignment score>
}}
It is mandatory that you respond only using the JSON format above,
