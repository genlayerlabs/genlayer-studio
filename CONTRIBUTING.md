# Contributing to GenLayer Simulator

We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to the GenLayer Simulator! This document will guide you through the contribution process.

## What is the GenLayer Simulator?

The GenLayer Simulator is an interactive sandbox designed for developers to explore the potential of GenLayer's Intelligent Contracts. It replicates the GenLayer network's execution environment and consensus algorithm, providing a controlled and local environment to test different ideas and behaviors.

## How You Can Contribute?

Contributions to the GenLayer Simulator are welcome in several forms:

### Testing the Simulator and Providing Feedback

Help us make the simulator better by testing and giving feedback:

- First, install the simulator using the GenLayer [CLI](https://github.com/yeagerai/genlayer-simulator?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-install).
- Try out the Simulator features and tell us what you think through our [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1IVNsZwm936kSNCiXmlAP8bgJnbik7Bqaoc3I6UYhr-o/viewform) or on our [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/8Jm4v89VAu).
- If you find any issues, please report them on our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/yeagerai/genlayer-simulator/issues).

### Sharing New Ideas and Use Cases

Have ideas for new features or usecases? We're eager to hear them! But first:

- Ensure you have the [Simulator installed](https://github.com/yeagerai/genlayer-simulator?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-install) first to explore existing use cases.
- After you've familiarized yourself with the simulator, contribute your unique use case and share your ideas in our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/8Jm4v89VAu).

### Writing Code

To contribute to feature development or bug fixes. Check our [issue tracker](https://github.com/yeagerai/genlayer-simulator/issues) for tasks labeled `help wanted`.

#### Code Live updating

If you want your code changes to be updated in the containers automatically.

```
$ cp docker-compose.dev.yml docker-compose.yml
```

#### VSCode Debugger

Unfortunatly Flask can not live update when running the VSCode debugger. So If you want to run through your code make sure to delete the containers, images and re-build as below.

```
<stop docker>
$ docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -q)
$ docker images
genlayer-simulator $ docker images
REPOSITORY                      TAG               IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
..........................      ......            ............   ...........    .....
genlayer-simulator-jsonrpc      ......            63127d2ca3b8   ...........    .....
genlayer-simulator-genvm        ......            aa6919d68922   ...........    .....
..........................      ......            ............   ...........    .....
$ docker rmi 63127d2ca3b8 aa6919d68922
$ vim .env
...
VSCODEDEBUG = "true"
...
$ docker compose up
...
```

Then do the same but `VSCODEDEBUG = "false"` to go back to hot reloading your code.

### Setup Simulator manually

#### Window One

```
$ cp .env.example .env
$ docker compose up
```

#### Window Two

1. Installing the Ollama model

   ```
   $ docker exec -it ollama ollama run llama3
   ```

2. Setup your environment

   - Linux / MacOS

     ```
     $ virtualenv .venv
     $ source .venv/bin/activate
     (.venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
     (.venv) $ export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)"
     ```

   - Windows (cmd)

     ```
     $ virtualenv .venv
     $  .\.venv\Scripts\activate
     (.venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
     (.venv) $ set PYTHONPATH=%cd%
     ```

   - Windows (PowerShell)

     ```
     $ virtualenv .venv
     $  .\.venv\Scripts\activate
     (.venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
     (.venv) $ $env:PYTHONPATH = (Get-Location).Path
     ```

3. Execute the Demo

   ```
   (.venv) $ python scripts/debug_simulator.py
   ```
